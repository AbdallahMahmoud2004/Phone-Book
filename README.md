# Phone-Book
## Overview
This is a simple Phone Book management system built in C++ to apply key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project demonstrates how to manage contact entries, search, and update records dynamically using basic OOP features like encapsulation and dynamic memory allocation.

## Features:
- Add new contacts with name and phone number validation.
- Search entries by name or phone number.
- Update contact names or phone numbers by index.
- Display individual or all contact entries.
- Copy the entire phone book to another instance.
- Clear phone book data to free memory.

## Concepts Demonstrated:
- **Encapsulation**: Managing data using private members and public methods.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Using pointers to handle phone book size dynamically.
- **Modular Design**: Separation of functionality into methods for ease of maintenance and readability.

## How to Use:
1. Set the phone book size.
2. Add new contacts.
3. Perform operations such as search, update, display, and copy phone book.
4. Optionally, clear the phone book data before exiting.

## Future Enhancements:
- Add functionality for saving and loading contacts to/from files.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Prerequisites:
- C++ compiler
