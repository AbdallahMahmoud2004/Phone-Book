# Phone-Book
Overview
This is a simple Phone Book management system built in C++ to apply key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project demonstrates how to manage contact entries, search, and update records dynamically using basic OOP features like encapsulation and dynamic memory allocation.

Features:
Add new contacts with name and phone number validation.
Search entries by name or phone number.
Update contact names or phone numbers by index.
Display individual or all contact entries.
Copy the entire phone book to another instance.
Clear phone book data to free memory.
Concepts Demonstrated:
Encapsulation: Managing data using private members and public methods.
Dynamic Memory Management: Using pointers to handle phone book size dynamically.
Modular Design: Separation of functionality into methods for ease of maintenance and readability.
How to Use:
Set the phone book size.
Add new contacts.
Perform operations such as search, update, display, and copy phone book.
Optionally, clear the phone book data before exiting.
Future Enhancements:
Add functionality for saving and loading contacts to/from files.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
Prerequisites:
C++ compiler
